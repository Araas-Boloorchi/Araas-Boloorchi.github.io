**Dissertation** 		

I improved the navigation of robots and autonomous vehicles by combining analytical and machine learning techniques. This includes using generative deep learning to detect anomaly in Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data, generate IMU data and fuse them with Visual Odometry coordination for consistent can concise spatial awareness. With the addition of explainable AI, the system boosts accuracy and adaptability in changing environments that can effectively function on Single Board Computers.

**ILead Lab project**

We created a new approach to making AI systems more understandable by using a framework that focuses on explaining AI decisions, especially for tasks like describing pie charts. It combines multiple AI agents to handle different parts of the explanation process, showcasing how this method can be applied in areas like image recognition and language translation to make AI's workings clearer.
